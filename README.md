# LSAP - (Linear Sum Assigment Problem)

Hungarian Algorithm for Linear Sum Assignment problems, implemented in C++. The algorithms in this part follow the algorithms presented in [chapter 4][2] of [Bukard][1].

<!-- Linearization of the Quadratic Assignment Problem for Linear Assignment Problem. -->

## This repository has:
